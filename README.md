===============================

Welcome to my version of the classic Frogger arcade game.

The goal is to avoid the lasers and move the Robot character from the red zone
at the botom of the screen to the orange zone at the top of the screen. 

As you progress through the levels the speed of the lasers will increase.

Health packs that spawn on the last row can be collected to increase the health
of the Robot.

Controls:

  Move left - left arrow key
  Move right - right arrow key
  Move up - up arrow key
  Move down - down arrow key

  Refresh the page to reset the game.

Thanks for playing!
